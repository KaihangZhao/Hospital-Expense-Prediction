# Hospital-Expense-Prediction

## Intro

This is a project to use PySpark(Spark SQL, Spark ML) and Mongodb to build distributed machine learning prediction on New York Hospital Expenses in patient level. There are three targests we consider in total: Length of Stay, Cost, Charges and Copayment Proportion. Our team members are  *Wei He*(whe13@usfca.edu), *Kaihang Zhao*(kzhao24@usfca.edu), *Jih-Chin Chen*(jchen217@usfca.edu), *Tong Wang*(twang77@usfca.edu) and *Yangzhou Tang*(ytang47@usfca.edu).

<img src="picture/pipeline.png" width="450" align="right"> In this project, we created **MongoDB Atlas** and sharded the data into three clusters to improve data management. Then we created a data pipeline to access **20GB+** of raw data from **AWS S3** and transferred the cleaned data to MongoDB Atlas. After performing data preprocessing, we loaded data from MongoDB Atlas and applied machine learning algorithms in a distributed system on **Databricks** using **Spark ML**.

## Raw Data Description

Our data contains New York Hospital Discharges data in the patient level from 2011 to 2013.

Furthermore, we merged extra small data points, including CPI, Race Ratio, and Sex Ratio in zip-code level to trying extract more features in demographic and economic level.



## Data Preprocessing


## ML Predictions
We built Random Forest models and Gradient Boosting models to predict three difference target, including length of stay, total costs and total charges. Using R_squared and Feature Importances as metrics, we evaluated and assessed each model and extracted intelligence from our models.

### 1. Length of Stay
### 2. Total Costs
### 3. Total Charges
